# What I Learnt
I learnt how to clone a project from GitHub and save it into my local drive. I also learnt how to create my own readme file to make using my codes easy for anyone who wishes to use them in the future. 
While the instructions were straightfoward, I still hit some hiccups. In hindsight, I should have read between the lines.

# Example README
# Work Process Simplifier

**Status:** Completed

I built a lightweight toolkit that streamlines my day-to-day work across research writing, product management, and creative publishing.

## What it does
- Automates repetitive prep (project folders, file naming, and brief templates).
- Generates ready-to-use outlines for proposals, reports, and chapters.
- Creates quick content packs (captions, carousels, and posting checklists) for Royale Scribes.
- Provides one-click dashboards for task priorities and deadlines.

## Results
- Cut setup time for new projects from hours to minutes.
- Reduced manual copy-pasting and formatting across documents.
- Improved consistency of deliverables for clients and internal projects.

## How I use it
I trigger a single command to scaffold a new project, then pick from pre-built templates and utilities. The toolkit keeps everything organized so I can focus on analysis, writing, and shipping.
