# Work Process Simplifier

This project aims to streamline and simplify my daily workflow, from research writing, project management, and data analysis to creative content planning. The goal is to build tools and automations that reduce repetitive tasks, keep my projects organized, and help me focus on meaningful work instead of manual routines.

Stay tuned for modules and scripts that make research, writing, and publishing faster and smarter.
